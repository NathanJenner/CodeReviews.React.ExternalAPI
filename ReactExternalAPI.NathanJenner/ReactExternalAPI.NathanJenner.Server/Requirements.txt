- You cannot use AXIOS to fetch the data, you have to use JS Fetch API
- You should create an API of your choice, with a model representing a single table.
- One of the properties of your API's model should be imageUrl, with a link to pictures that will be shown by the react app.
- You can choose whatever ORM you want: Dapper, EF, ADO.NET.
